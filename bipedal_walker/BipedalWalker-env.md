## Actions

Type: Box(4) - Torque control(default) / Velocity control - Change inside `/envs/box2d/bipedal_walker.py` line 363

Num | Name                        | Min  | Max  
----|-----------------------------|------|------
0   | Hip_1 (Torque / Velocity)   |  -1  | +1
1   | Knee_1 (Torque / Velocity)  |  -1  | +1
2   | Hip_2 (Torque / Velocity)   |  -1  | +1
3   | Knee_2 (Torque / Velocity)  |  -1  | +1

## Reward

Reward is given for moving forward, total 300+ points up to the far end. If the robot falls, it gets -100. Applying motor torque costs a small amount of points, more optimal agent will get better score. State consists of hull angle speed, angular velocity, horizontal speed, vertical speed, position of joints and joints angular speed, legs contact with ground, and 10 lidar rangefinder measurements. There's no coordinates in the state vector.
## Starting State

Random position upright and mostly straight legs.

## Episode Termination

The episode ends when the robot body touches ground or the robot reaches far right side of the environment.

## Solved Requirements

BipedalWalker-v2 defines "solving" as getting average reward of 300 over 100 consecutive trials
